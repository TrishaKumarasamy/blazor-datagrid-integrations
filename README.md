# Blazor DataGrid Integrations

A comprehensive guide demonstrating how to integrate and use the **Blazor DataGrid** component with multiple backend services. This repository contains production-ready sample applications showing complete CRUD operations, real-time data synchronization, and advanced data management patterns.

## Overview

This project showcases two distinct integration patterns for the Blazor DataGrid using custom adaptors:

- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Full-text search with document indexing and distributed querying capabilities
- **SignalR Real-Time Updates**: Live data synchronization with server-pushed updates for real-time dashboards

Each sample demonstrates best practices including dependency injection, repository patterns, custom data adaptors, and proper error handling.

## Features

Both samples share the following capabilities across their respective backends:

- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, delete, and retrieve records directly from the grid
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**: Multi-column filtering, custom sort orders, and range queries
- **Server-Side Paging**: Efficient handling of large datasets with configurable page sizes
- **Custom Data Adaptors**: Full control over grid data operations using DataAdaptor pattern
- **Search Functionality**: Query data across multiple fields with flexible search capabilities
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean service architecture with DI container integration
- **Repository Pattern**: Separation of concerns between data access and business logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management and validation
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based settings via `appsettings.json`
